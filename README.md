Relfection:

This assignment felt like a nice break from the tech issues from A1. Without all of the tech issues, I was able to focus more on my actual coding skills, specifically how to work with ArrayLists. One thing that I would like to learn more about and work on more in the future are the other methods for ArrayLists such as sublists. I think learning more about those methods and how they function will help me improve my coding and make it more efficient. 

For this assignment I collaborated with Eliza Gilchrist.
